						<p>
							You have probably heard it over and over again: choosing a college is one of the most important decisions you will make in your life. And it's true. Where you attend college will have a lasting impact on your personal and professional life.But the truth is, many students select a college based on emotion or a very limited set of criteria-sometimes just a gut feeling. While this won't preclude you from academic success, such an important decision should probably undergo a higher level of scrutiny.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you're shopping around for colleges, you're going to want to consider a broad range of factors, such as location, size, cost, academic quality, campus safety, choice of majors, as well as other factors that are important to you personally.Below are some important factors to consider when choosing a college. These factors start general and get more specific. As you narrow down your list of schools, you're going to want to ask more detailed questions and dig deeper to find out if that school will be a good fit for you. 
						</p>
						
						<blockquote>
							Before selecting colleges, students must decide what courses of study they are going to pursue, bearing in mind their academic interest and performance at the school level.One of the ways to choose the best college is to conduct extensive research. While doing that, it is imperative that one does not make ranking the foremost criteria. Another key factor in choosing a college has to 'your learning style'.
                            Increasingly, young people have the option of going to a college that suits their learning style. Many students assume that a recognised brand name will guarantee success in future
						</blockquote>
						
						<h3>Ask Yourself Why You are Going to College</h3>
						<p>
							This is a simple question, but the answer rarely is. Most high school students don't know what they want to do when they grow up. But remember, you're choosing a college, not a major. Selecting the best college is just as much a process of learning about yourself as it is about prospective schools.You may not know what career you want to pursue after graduation, but you certainly know what your interests are and what you're good at. Thinking about this will help you figure out if you're leaning towards liberal arts or a technical field.
                            Self-reflection will also help you get a grasp on other factors. Do you want to attend a large or small school? Far away or close to home? Expensive or affordable? As you ask yourself these questions, you will begin to have a better understanding of your own priorities.
                            It may even be possible that you're not quite ready for college yet. You may want to take a year off, but make sure that you spend it wisely. Other countries have a tradition of students taking a year after high school to travel, work or volunteer. This is not a tradition in the United States, so you want to make sure you do something productive with your time. When you finally do apply for colleges, they will want to know what you did with your free time during the prime of your life.</p>
						
						<h4>Geographic Location</h4>
						<p>Most students have an idea as to whether they would like to stay close to home or not. Do you want to live in a big city or somewhere a little quieter? Does a party campus sound like a fun part of the college experience or just a distraction? What about weather and regional culture?Perhaps most importantly, can you afford to go out-of-state, especially to a more expensive big city? We'll discuss cost in more detail below, but choosing to attend college outside of your home state will automatically make everything more expensive.</p>
						<p>Geographic location can have a big impact on your overall college experience. Even if you like the school, if you hate where it's located the next four years could be tough. If you're looking at schools in a particular city, make sure you actually like it there. If you haven't visited in a while, you should probably schedule a trip.</p>
